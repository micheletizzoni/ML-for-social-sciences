# ML-for-social-sciences

The repo contains the material for the short course entitled "Machine Learning for the Social Sciences", which I have taught to the students of the Doctoral Programme in Sociology and Social Research at the University of Trento.

The content of the slides is based on the previous version of the course taught by (https://github.com/gcampede/Machine-Learning-for-the-Social-Sciences-ML4SS)[Gian Maria Campedelli].
